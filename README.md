## TODO
- [ ] Implementing LSTM for text parsing
- [ ] Improve on Diagram Parser
- [ ] Extend geometry3k dataset
- [ ] Include more problems from Indian textbooks
- [ ] Improvement on Text Parsing by increasing Dataset
- [ ] 500 extra problems target
- [ ] Web scraping (if available on website) otherwise PDF scraping
- [ ] Try different transformer models for theorem predictor
- [ ] Explore low-data learning approaches like finetuning, few-shot learning for theorem predictor
- [ ] If possible, extend this concept to a construction predictor
